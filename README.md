  ## Description
  This is a Note Taker site. Created and processed through Node.js in your computer's terminal and launched through Render.com. You can add notes with a title and a body of notes and save them to be referred to in the future as needed.

  ## Installation
  There is no installation needed. You would just need to go to the URL and launch the site. 

  ## Usage
  The site starts off at the home page with a title "Note Taker" and one button called "get started". When you click on the "get started" button that will take you to the next page. On the left hand side you will have previous notes saved and you can click on them to see the title and the notes that were left in the body. If you click on the "Note Title" field, you can add the title and then tab to the next field, which is the "note text" field and add all of the notes need. Once those fields have been populated, two buttons will appear on the top right hand side. One is "Save Notes", that will save what you have in the two fields and populate on the left hand side to reference or you have "Clear Form", which will delete the fields if you need to change them.
